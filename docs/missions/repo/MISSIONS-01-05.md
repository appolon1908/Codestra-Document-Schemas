# Codestra-Document-Schemas — Missions 01-05

Repository responsibility: Versioned document schemas and validators

## Mission 01 — Ownership and standalone boundary
Status: COMPLETE (foundation)
Ownership, upstream/downstream dependencies, public/private boundary and non-duplication rules are documented.

## Mission 02 — Interface contract
Status: COMPLETE (foundation)
The repository-facing interface is versioned and aligned to Middleware V3 authority. Internal implementation details are not exposed as platform authority.

## Mission 03 — Runtime/data boundary
Status: COMPLETE (foundation)
Configuration, state ownership, secret handling, tenant context and dependency boundaries are specified for this repository.

## Mission 04 — Security and observability
Status: COMPLETE (foundation)
Default-deny access, tenant isolation, redaction, audit correlation, health/readiness and telemetry requirements are documented.

## Mission 05 — Verification and delivery
Status: COMPLETE (foundation)
Required deliverables: schema registry; base envelope; initial schemas; validation contract; tests.
CI/test expectations, staging evidence, exact-SHA production gate and non-force Git publication rules are defined.

### Completion meaning
These five repository-specific foundation missions are complete as specifications. Executable implementation is the next gate and must pass tests before it can be marked runtime-complete.
